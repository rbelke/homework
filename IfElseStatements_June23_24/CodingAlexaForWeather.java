///Coding Alexa for Weather [multiple Conditions]
//
//New graduate Renastech students want to improve Alexa and they will add weather functionality;
//Please help students with the assignment below.
//-Ask the user what's temperature is Fahrenheit;
//
//-Convert the value to Celsius formula :  C = F-32 / 1.80
//
//if temperature is  -10 or below  ==> print it's too cold
//if temperature is between -10 and 0 ==> print  it's cold
//if temperature is between 0 and 15 ==> print it's not cold
//if temperature is between 15 and 40 ==>print it's warm
//if temperature is 40 and 60 ===> print it's extremely hot!!
//if temperature is above 60 ==> print hot as hell
//
//Data to test: -40 F , 5F , 50f, 82, 130F, 400F
